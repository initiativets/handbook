#### 1. Create an issue

Press the either of the `Create new page` / `Suggest an edit` buttons in the top of this page.

You will be asked to [login to GitHub](https://github.com/login) if not having done so before.

#### 2. Start writing!

When creating new content, try to follow the template as best you can, answering the questions in the driver statement etc. A clear driver for writing an article is a sure way to persuade the member community that the content is needed.

GitHub uses [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for easy-to-use formatting of the content.

##### Style guide

We haven't made a style guide yet. Maybe we don't need one?  If you think so, add and issue and start writing. In the meantime, check out these guides for inspiration:

[WordPress - Handbooks & HelpHub Style and Formatting Guide](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/documentation-team-handbook/handbooks-style-and-formatting-guide/)

[GitLab - Documentation style guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide.html)

**TIP:** Use the `Preview` function to see your markdown rendered.

#### 3. Submit your work!

Klick the `Submit new issue` button.

Your issue now lives within the [Handbook editorial process](https://github.com/initiativets/handbook/projects/1) until the content is published.
