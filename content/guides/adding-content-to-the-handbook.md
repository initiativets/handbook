So, you have identified something that needs to be added to the handbook? Great! The IN handbook is created and maintained in a collaborative effort and access is granted to all members. Access is not just granted, you are also actively encouraged to participate in the process!

**What should you write about?** Only you know. If you have identified something in the workings of the organisation that is unclear/ambiguous, then that probably is a good candidate for an article.

**Do you have an idea for an article but not the capacity and/or knowledge to finish it yourself?** No worries, add it anyway! Hopefully someone else will pick it up and finish it. Remember, team effort.

## Prerequisites

You need a **[GitHub account](https://github.com/join)** to add content to the handbook. If you don't have an account, visit [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join) and create one.

If you have no idea what GitHub is, please read [this guide first](/guides/github)

When you have created an account, you need to be invited as a member of the IN GitHub organisation. #21

## Issues

IN uses the GitHub concept of [issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to keep track of new articles and content ideas.

**What is an issue anyway?**

From [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/):

> Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. Theyâ€™re kind of like email - except they can be shared and discussed with the rest of your team.

For the context of the handbook, you could for example view issues as post-its on a whiteboard during a co-creation session, or as shared documents with a memory and a direction.

- One issue represents one article or idea
- Issues are added to a virtual whiteboard called the [Handbook editorial process](https://github.com/initiativets/handbook/projects)

### Creating an issue

#### 1. Log in to GitHub

#### 2. Create an issue

Navigate to [/initiativets/handbook/issues](/initiativets/handbook/issues) and press `New issue`.

#### 3. Select a template

**(TODO: More info needed here)**

#### 4. Start writing!

Try to follow the template as best you can, answering the questions in the driver statement etc. A clear driver for writing an article is a sure way to persuade the member community that the content is needed.

GitHub uses [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for easy-to-use formatting of the content.

##### Style guide

We haven't made a style guide yet. Maybe we don't need one?  If you think so, add and issue and start writing. In the meantime, check out these guides for inspiration:

[WordPress - Handbooks & HelpHub Style and Formatting Guide](https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/documentation-team-handbook/handbooks-style-and-formatting-guide/)

[GitLab - Documentation style guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide.html)

#### 5. Tag content with label `content`

This helps distinguish this issue from other kinds of issues - bug reports, etc.

[Applying labels to issues and pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/applying-labels-to-issues-and-pull-requests/)

**(TODO: can we automate this? Can e.g. templates have default labels?)**

#### 6. Add issue to project board

Add the issue to the project board by clicking `Projects` in the right hand column and selecting `Handbook editorial process`.

## Process

Issues related to the handbook live inside the [Handbook editorial process](https://github.com/initiativets/handbook/projects/1). The process uses a built in feature of GitHub called project boards, which allows issues to be placed on a [kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) style board where each column represents a stage of the overall process.

Stages:

### 1. `Content ideas`

Newly created issues starts their life here. Before moving issues out of this column, seek consent from the community to make sure it is a good idea investing time in creating the content.

**(CLARIFY: How is this consent achieved - who / how many / etc?)**

### 2. `Ready to be written`

After having found consent, move issue to this column **when you are not planning to be the author** of the content yourself. Anyone with relevant expertise/interest/drive can pick up an issue from this column and move on to

### 3. `In progress`

Ready to start writing? After having found consent, move issue to this column, tag yourself as assignee and start typing. Make sure to involve others in the process; Seek advice continuously.

### 4. `Editing`

When you feel you have a solid draft, move the issue to this column. The issue is now in editing mode where it will receive finishing touches from the IN editorial team **(???)**. Before moving issue to the next column, seek consent to publish **(HOW?)**.

**(CLARIFY: Is there a role - editor - responsible for editing?)**
**(CLARIFY: How is this consent achieved - who / how many / etc?)**

### 5. `Ready to be published`

Issues in this column are awaiting to be published. The content of the issue is added to the handbook by Initiativet Tech Team #25

### 6. `Published / Celebrate`

When an issue ends up here it has successfully been added to the handbook. Yay!! ðŸŽ‰
